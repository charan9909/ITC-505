    <h2>Development Addendum</h2>
    <p><strong>Creative Process:</strong> I designed a clean grid with color contrast to represent the “on” and “off” states. I wanted the interface to be intuitive and fast to interact with.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Randomizing the game while ensuring it's always solvable was a challenge. I overcame this by simulating a set of random user clicks on a blank board. This guarantees a solvable configuration each time.</p>
    <p><strong>Insights:</strong> This project taught me the importance of separating concerns in web development — styling, logic, and structure. I also learned how to manipulate the DOM effectively and detect win conditions based on CSS class states.</p>
    <p><strong>Font Handling:</strong> Default fonts were used to ensure consistent cross-platform rendering. No custom font serving was needed in this version.</p>
